# Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Concepts and Benefits

## What is IaC?
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code and automation, rather than manual processes. It uses declarative or imperative code to define and deploy infrastructure resources like servers, networks, and databases.

## Benefits of IaC
1. **Deployment Consistency**: IaC ensures that the same infrastructure is deployed every time, eliminating configuration drift and inconsistencies.
2. **Reduced Manual Errors**: Automating infrastructure provisioning reduces human errors that occur during manual setups.
3. **Version Control**: Infrastructure code can be versioned using tools like Git, enabling tracking of changes, rollbacks, and collaboration.
4. **Scalability**: IaC allows for easy scaling of infrastructure by reusing code for multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Automated resource management helps avoid over-provisioning and reduces wasted resources.

## Examples of IaC Benefits
- **Consistency**: Using Terraform to deploy an EC2 instance ensures the same configuration is applied across all environments.
- **Error Reduction**: Automating network configuration with Ansible eliminates typos or misconfigurations.
- **Version Control**: Storing CloudFormation templates in Git allows teams to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
